! This data file contains command files, and for each command file a set if
! OMI commands that will be handled by this procedure.
!
! To add a toolbox, simply create a command file that handles the OMI
! commands with the following header:
!
!     $ GOSUB 'p1'$      ! Or use GOTO if all subroutines contain an EXIT
!     $ EXIT
!
! Make sure the command file contains subroutines for all commands with
! the following label:
!
!     my-command$
!
! You cannot change this label lay-out, since OMI checks for the existance of
! this label during startup.
!
! If you add a section to this file, (above the <EOF> statement!)
! it should look like this (case insensitive):
!
!   [My_ToolBox]
!     my-easy-command
!     my-usefull-command
!     my-other-tool
!
!  This will define the following commands:
!     OMI$MY-EASY-COMMAND
!     OMI$MY-USEFULL-COMMAND
!     OMI$MY-OTHER-TOOL
!
!  The file OMI$:MY_TOOLBOX.COM should have the following lay-out:
!
!    $  EXIT_STATUS = OMI$_OK ! Routines can change the to OMI$_WARNING or 
!                             ! OMI$_ERROR when errors show up.
!    $  GOSUB 'p1'$
!    $  EXIT 'EXIT_STATUS'
!
!    $ MY-EASY-COMMAND$:
!    $!
!    $   <Write your DCL code here>
!    $  RETURN
!    $!
!    $ MY-USEFULL-COMMAND$:
!    $!
!    $   <Write your DCL code here>
!    $  RETURN
