1.4a	Released: 21-04-1998
                                                                               
This version is distributed as a patch for v1.4, and fixes a bug in de command
element type using the DCL command 
The patch is still available as a 3 kB ascii file at
ftp://ftp.oveas.net/pub/oveas/omi/omi$patch_1-4a.com, but can only be used for
v1.4. If you still use this version, an upgrade is recommended.

  name for what it does. The old OMI$INSTALL.COM is now called

  OMI$SETUP.COM manually, more directories can be added.

  file type was not specified

  from OMI modules.
* Added the PROMPT element to the menu sections, to allow different prompts
  for all menu levels.
* OMI now displays the percentage of lines read from the menu file during
  initialization. This is usefull for large menu files.
* Added the SHOW_PROGRESS and PROTECT_PROMPT elements to the configuration

  screen in stead of running out of the screen.

  configuration file are required.
* Added checks in the configuration routine to encounter duplicate items. The
  user will now be prompted to ask if an existing item should be overwritten.

  everybody who tried hard enough found the encryption method by now. The new
  method can still decrypt strings encrypted with v1.0b3 and up.

  password is given the user can retry it, three times in total.

  *NOTE*	Due to this, password checks will now fail if the password

		file, after which it will default to 'Omi$System'. It can then
		be set again with the SET PASSWORD command.
